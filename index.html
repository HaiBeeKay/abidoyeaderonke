                        current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel
                        I got every penny's worth.

                        transition and have heard some people who
                        had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the best intro course and found it
                        incredibly fun! i enrolled shortly thereafter.
                        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most (-----) - time of my life. Since completing the
                        course, I've successfully switched courses,
                        working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup."

                        "Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step.
                        I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not dissappoint.
                        They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. the aple learn project, in particular was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level 
                        in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me
                        land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend."
